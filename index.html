                The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/131805-sci-fi-fantasy-girlz">Sci-Fi & Fantasy Girlz</a> is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> group created on April 5th 2014. The group primarily focuses on science fiction and fantasy written by women. We also discuss works written by men that feature female protagonists/main characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                This small analysis explores our group's members and the books that we have read and discussed.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Books We Have Read</h2>

            <p>To the date I gathered this data, our group had read 24 books from different categories like epic fantasy, science fiction, historical fiction and even chick lit! (according to Goodreads, anyway)</p>
            <p>We started doing two bi-monthly selections, then this year we decided to try something different and started selecting one book each month.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Below is a chart that displays the books we have read so far. I wanted to compare how we rated the books as a group against Goodreads average ratings. So in this chart, you will see the group's average rating displayed as green bars, and Goodread's average rating represented by the blue lines.</p>
            <p class="alert alert-info"><b>You can click on any bar on the chart to see more info about the book.</b></p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">That's All Folks!</h2>
        <p>
            That's all, for now. I want to keep getting more insights out of our group's data.
            Among the things I want to explore are what are we discussing on the group's forums, how are members are connected and what else do we read.
        </p>
        <p>My next step is to go deeper into the books our members read. </p>

            <h2>About this analysis</h2>
            <p>The data gathering and processing requried for this analysis was done in R using Goodread's publicly available API. It is based on data captured on April, 2016. After processing the final data was exported in json format.</p>
            <p>This document is HTML with Kendo Charts for the charts, plot.ly for the world map, and Javascript for connecting everything together. </p>
            <p>I will eventually get my scripts ready for public consumption and put them on Github, but for now, no one should be exposed to that mess :)</p>
