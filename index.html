            <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/131805-sci-fi-fantasy-girlz">Sci-Fi & Fantasy Girlz</a> is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> group created on April 5th 2014. The group primarily focuses on science fiction and fantasy written by women. We also discuss works written by men that feature female protagonists/main characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to explore our group. Who are members are, our reading preferences, so I gathered some data via the Goodreads API and analized it with R.
                On this page is a summary of what I found.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Books We Have Read</h2>

            <p>To the date I gathered this data, our group had read 24 books from different categories like epic fantasy, science fiction, historical fiction and even chick lit! (according to Goodreads, anyway)</p>
            <p>We started doing two bi-monthly selections, then this year we decided to try something different and started selecting one book each month.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I wanted to compare our group members ratings against Goodreads average ratings. So in the following chart, you will see the group's average rating displayed as green bars, and Goodread's average rating represented by the blue lines. </p>
            <p class="alert alert-info"><b>You can click on any value on the chart to see more info about that particular book.</b></p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">What our members read</h2>
        <p>I also explored what other kinds of books the members of the group reads. For this, I downloaded a list of all the books read by users and got the shelves for each book on Goodreads. We read many different genres, but we seem to share the love for fantasy and science fiction.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">That's all folks!</h2>
        <p>That's all, for now. I still want to explore our group's social composition and do some analysis on our discussions. After I complete that, I will share my findings.</p>

            <h2>About this analysis</h2>
            <p>The data gathering and processing required for this analysis were done in R using Goodread's publicly available API. It is based on data captured on April, 2016. After processing the final data was exported in json format in order to be included in this page.</p>
            <p>This document was created using Kendo UI for the charts and map. Javascript was used to glue everything together. </p>
            <p>I will eventually get my scripts ready for public consumption and share them on Github, but for now, no one should be exposed to that mess :)</p>
            <h2>Data Privacy</h2>
            <p>This data was gathered using Goodread's API which respects the privacy setting for users. Data from users with a private profile is not available, so their data is not included in this analysis.</p>
